# Blood-Donation-Camp-Registry
This Python-based console application efficiently manages donor records for a blood donation camp, offering capabilities to add, view, search, update, delete, and report eligibility.
Built using lists and dictionaries, the system demonstrates modular design through functions and a clean user menu.
It includes built-in eligibility logic checking age, weight, and months since last donation — ensuring only qualified donors are flagged.<br>
